## Hello World 👋

I'm a Fellow of the Openmind Research Institute and an Adjunct Professor of Computing Science at the University of Alberta. My research aims to understand the computational principles behind both natural and artificial minds.

- 🍒 Previously worked on theory of the [Reward Hypothesis](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2212.10420).
- ☝️ Currently working on algorithms for reward compilation.
- ✌️ Also pursuing a theoretical understanding of agency relative to classic models of computation.
- 💡 Excited to learn about how AI theory might explain natural forms of mental phenomena.
- 🏔️ I co-founded [Seattle Minds and Machines](https://seattlemindsandmachines.com/): a local seminar series for RL/AI researchers and computational neuroscientists.  
- 🚁 In a previous life I designed helicopters: [X76](https://interactive.rotorandwing.com/matrix-the-digital-co-pilot/).
