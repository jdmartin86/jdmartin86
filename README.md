## Hello World 👋

I'm a Fellow of the Openmind Research Institute and an Adjunct Professor of Computing Science at the University of Alberta. My research aims to understand the computational principles behind both natural and artificial minds.

- 🌱 Currently working on algorithms for reward compilation and a theoretical understanding of interaction relative to classic models of computation.
- 💡 Excited to learn how AI theory might explain natural forms of mental phenomena.
- 🏔️ I co-founded [Seattle Minds and Machines](https://seattlemindsandmachines.com/): a local seminar series for RL/AI researchers and computational neuroscientists.  
- 🚁 In a previous life I designed helicopters: [X76](https://interactive.rotorandwing.com/matrix-the-digital-co-pilot/).
